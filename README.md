## Installation - Use (macOS only at the moment)
1. Install Apple Developer Tools
2. Get current release (todo add link)
3. Navigate to the release folder in terminal, run `./install_dependencies.sh`. That will install [liblo](http://liblo.sourceforge.net/) as well as [libmapper](https://libmapper.github.io/) to your machine (specifically, to `/usr/local/include` and `/usr/local/lib`)
4. Execute `music-vis-backend-package.pkg` and follow the installation process. This will install a standalone version of the software as well as audio plugins in the VST3 and AU formats
5. Open your favourite DAW (Ableton Live) and add the `music-vis-backend` plugin to a track
6. Open the `WebMapper` application in the release folder. (*Optional: Drag the `WebMapper` application to your `Applications` folder for easy access.*)
