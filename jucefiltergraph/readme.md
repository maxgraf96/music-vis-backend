This folder contains the code for the FilterGraph component adapted from Sean Enderby's implementation 
(see https://sourceforge.net/projects/jucefiltergraph/). The FilterGraph is a GUI element that visualises the frequency
response of filters. Here it is used to allow for visual feedback and cutoff frequency adjustments for the two filters 
used to create the sub-bands.
